(Dinah was the cat .) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>",

And then you'll think of four. Then five or six or seven zebras. Maybe even more. And then you'll think of zebra herds stampeding down the street, and zebras wearing tutus, disco-dancing to a beat. You'll think of flying ninja zebras practicing kung fu. And zebra clowns from outer space. And robot zebras too. And zebras in pajama bottoms bouncing on their beds, and maybe even zebras wearing diapers on their heads. You'll wish you'd never thought of them, so do it starting now: Don't think about a zebra. Only think about a cow.</p>",
